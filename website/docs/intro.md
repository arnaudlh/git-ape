# Git-Ape

:::warning
**EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT:** Git-Ape is in active development and is not production-ready. Use it for local development, demos, sandbox subscriptions, and learning only.
:::

Git-Ape is a **platform engineering framework** built on GitHub Copilot. It provides a structured, multi-agent system for planning, validating, and deploying Azure infrastructure — with security gates, cost analysis, and CI/CD pipeline integration built in.

## What It Does

- **Gather deployment requirements** through guided conversations
- **Generate ARM templates** and supporting deployment artifacts
- **Run security, preflight, and cost checks** before deployment
- **Deploy and validate** with post-deployment health checks
- **Manage lifecycle** with drift detection and teardown workflows

## Deployment Flow

    U["User prompt:<br/>deploy a Python function app"]
    U --> S1
    S1["Stage 1: Requirements<br/>Gather inputs, validate naming & SKUs"]
    S1 --> S2
    S2["Stage 2: Template & Analysis<br/>Generate ARM + security + cost"]
    S2 --> GATE
    GATE{{"Security Gate"}}
    GATE -- "BLOCKED" --> FIX["Fix & retry"]
    FIX --> S2
    GATE -- "PASSED" --> CONFIRM

    CONFIRM --> S3
    S3["Stage 3: Deploy"]
    S3 --> S4
    S4["Stage 4: Validate & Test"]
```

## Execution Modes

Git-Ape works in two modes:

- **Interactive (VS Code)** — Talk to `@git-ape` in Copilot Chat, authenticate via `az login`, approve each step in real time.
- **Headless (Coding Agent)** — Copilot Coding Agent picks up a GitHub Issue, generates templates on a branch, opens a PR, and CI/CD workflows handle the rest.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the plugin
copilot plugin marketplace add Azure/git-ape-private
copilot plugin install Azure/git-ape-private

# Check prerequisites
# In Copilot Chat: /prereq-check

# Deploy something
# In Copilot Chat: @git-ape deploy a Python function app
```
