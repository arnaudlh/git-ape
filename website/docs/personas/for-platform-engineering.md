# Git-Ape for Platform Engineering

> **TL;DR** — Git-Ape is your self-service deployment platform with built-in guardrails. Developers deploy independently while you maintain security, naming, policy, and cost standards.

</FeatureGrid>

## The Platform Engineer's Dilemma

You want developers to be self-service, but you also need:
- Consistent naming across all resources
- Security baselines enforced on every deployment
- Cost visibility before resources are created
- Policy compliance without manual review

Git-Ape solves this by embedding platform engineering standards directly into the deployment conversation.

## Built-in Guardrails

### Naming Standards

Every resource name is validated against Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) conventions:

```
Format: {caf-abbrev}-{project}-{environment}-{region}

Examples:
  func-orderapi-dev-eastus      ← Function App
  st-orderapi-dev-8k3m          ← Storage Account
  kv-orderapi-prod-eus          ← Key Vault
```

The `azure-naming-research` skill automatically:
- Looks up CAF abbreviations for the resource type
- Validates length constraints (min/max characters)
- Checks valid character sets
- Verifies uniqueness scope (global, resource group, subscription)

### Security Guardrails

| Guardrail | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Managed identities | Always — no connection strings |
| Shared key access | Disabled on storage accounts |
| FTP state | Disabled on all App Services |
| TLS version | Minimum 1.2 everywhere |
| HTTPS only | Enforced on all web-facing resources |
| AAD-only auth | Enabled on SQL databases |
| Key Vault references | Used for all secrets in app settings |

### Policy Compliance

The `azure-policy-advisor` skill assesses ARM templates against:
- **CIS Azure Foundations v3.0**
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5**
- Custom organizational policies
- Existing subscription-level policy assignments

Output includes specific recommendations with built-in policy definition IDs.

## Multi-Environment Management

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph DEV["Development"]
        D1["rg-app-dev-eastus"]
        D2["Contributor RBAC"]
        D3["Dev SKUs"]
    end
    subgraph STG["Staging"]
        S1["rg-app-staging-eastus"]
        S2["Contributor RBAC"]
        S3["Prod-like SKUs"]
    end
    subgraph PROD["Production"]
        P1["rg-app-prod-eastus"]
        P2["Required reviewers"]
        P3["Production SKUs"]
    end

    DEV --> |"PR + auto-deploy"| STG
    STG --> |"Approved PR + manual gate"| PROD
```

Each environment gets:
- Separate resource groups with environment-specific naming
- Appropriate RBAC assignments
- Environment-specific SKU sizing
- GitHub environment protection rules (optional reviewers for prod)

## Self-Service Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant GA as Git-Ape
    participant Gate as Security Gate
    participant Platform as Platform Standards

    Dev->>GA: "Deploy a Cosmos DB for user data"
    GA->>Platform: Validate naming (CAF)
    GA->>Platform: Check policy compliance
    GA->>Platform: Verify RBAC standards
    GA->>Gate: Run security analysis
    Gate-->>GA: ✅ PASSED
    GA->>Dev: "Plan ready — cost: $X/mo"
    Dev->>GA: Approved
    GA->>GA: Deploy + test + commit state
```

Developers get self-service speed. You get governance and compliance. No ticket queue.
