# Policy Compliance

> **TL;DR** — The `@azure-policy-advisor` agent checks your ARM template against subscription policies and recommends additional policies. Advisory only — it surfaces findings without blocking.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    TEMPLATE["ARM Template"] --> SCAN["Policy Advisor<br/>scans resources"]
    SCAN --> ASSIGNED["Check against<br/>assigned policies"]
    SCAN --> UNASSIGNED["Recommend<br/>unassigned policies"]
    ASSIGNED --> PART1["Part 1: Template<br/>Improvements"]
    UNASSIGNED --> PART2["Part 2: Subscription<br/>Policy Assignments"]
    PART1 --> REPORT["policy-assessment.md"]
    PART2 --> REPORT
```

## Invoke It

```
@azure-policy-advisor assess my template
```

## Report Structure

### Part 1: Template Improvements

Issues found in the ARM template that conflict with assigned policies:

| Resource | Policy | Effect | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Storage Account | Require HTTPS | Deny | ✅ Compliant |
| Function App | Require managed identity | Audit | ⚠️ Not configured |
| SQL Server | Require AAD-only auth | Deny | ✅ Compliant |

### Part 2: Recommended Policy Assignments

Policies from Microsoft Learn best practices that are not yet assigned to your subscription:

| Category | Policy | Effect | Recommendation |
|----------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Storage | Require TLS 1.2 | Deny | Assign to prevent legacy TLS |
| Compute | Require HTTPS-only | Deny | Assign to enforce encryption |
| Monitoring | Require diagnostic settings | AuditIfNotExists | Assign for visibility |

## Compliance Frameworks

Git-Ape supports assessment against:

- **CIS Azure Foundations v3.0**
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5**
